# CS-330-Portfolio

For this project we had to take a picture of a scene and design it in a 3d environment using different shapes. Coming in as a complete novice I chose to start with figuring out what shapes each item would be made out of and how they could be textured to reflect the scene properly. Afterwards I worked on figuring out how to place different objects in the scene starting with the playmat. Eventually after lots of trial and error I feel I was able to near perfectly place most of the items as well as get them to a pretty close scale. Adding in the textures to make the objects match each indivitual items look was next, finding and/or making these took a long time but I feel I was able to replicate things decently. Identifying each items materials and their respective reflectivities was challenging but I feel I was able to do it well. The only part I feel I could do better was making the UV map for each individual dice with numbers for each side, which I feel I could do with a good UV mapping software, although I wasn't able to find one for free. 
This was particularly fun as I hope to make my own games for fun and it felt like a true dive into what I hope to be working on in the future. I hope to find a job working in technology that I can put these skills to use, although a job adjacent to the field would be fine as I also hope to spend my free time designing my own games.
